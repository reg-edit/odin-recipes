    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Dark and with the rich taste of a demi-glace, this sweet-sour and intensely onion soup lingers on the tongue like a fine wine. Its flavor is really too assertive for a first course, but it makes an excellent lunch with half a sandwich, or a dinner with crusty bread, salad, and the rest of that red wine. Many thanks to "Anon." for sending in this superb recipe. Serve hot to 4-6 people.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <lu>
            <li>3 Tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>5 pounds red onions, sliced as paper thin as possible to make the marmalade almost syrupy</li>
            <li>½ cup red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>¾ cup red wine</li>
            <li>8 cups beef stock</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>flavoring bundle of a celery stalk, bay leaf, and parsley stems tied together</li>
        </lu>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <lo>
            <li>In a large soup pot, heat the olive oil, then stir in the onions--and there are LOTS of them. </li>
            <li>Sauté, stirring frequently, until the onions are completely wilted and turning nicely brown, almost like an onion marmalade</li>
            <li>This takes a long time, some 20 minutes or so, and they will cook down a lot. Stir in the vinegar, and cook it down until it is mostly evaporated.</li>
            <li>This is key--you don't want to add the wine until the vinegar is really cooked down. Stir in the wine, and let cook it down quite a bit</li>
            <li>Finally, stir in the beef stock and chicken stock and bring to a boil. Add the celery bundle, salt, and pepper, then reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes or so, to mix flavors.</li>
